# SecuritySuite

Due to the initially limiting nature of security tools that require a technical knowhow to use, this webconsole based suite was designed to allow non technical people an easy use of some common security tools.  This tool is designed to be modular and can have tools added or removed as needed.

This was designed as part of a college project and will be expanded on when the whim takes me.
